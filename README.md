# boost_light

Very light version of some boost modules.

This idea is to provide a minimalist version of modules originally
provided by boost.

The interface and the implementation of the modules are different from the
legacy ones. It aims to provide only a skeleton so that a developer can extend
it to meet its project specific needs.

# Features

* lsm.h: light state machine that provides an independant header-only state machine module (minimal boost msm)
